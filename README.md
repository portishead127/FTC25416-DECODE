# Y14 DECODE CODEBASE

### Please don't listen to AGP or Gradle if it tells you to sync or anything. Gradle is evil.

### Connecting to the robot

1. Turn the robot on and wait until there is a green light visible on the control hub.
2. Connect to the new WiFi connection. It should be something like 25416-RC or 556-RC.
3. You're connected now! Although you won't be able to push code to the robot controller without a little more setup that I can't get find right now. Remind Aaron sometime.
4. However, from here you can use FTCDashboard to see telemetry and run OpModes from the driver hub.
